# Project Brief: Vibe-Code Starter Landing Page

## 🎯 Goal

To create a high-converting, single-page landing website for the premium product, **"The Vibe-Coding Starter Kit,"** focusing on two primary value propositions:

1. **Instant launch speed** (under 5 minutes)
2. **Guaranteed designer-grade aesthetic** (saving AI tokens)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Target Audience (The Vibe Coder)

**Primary:** Non-technical founders, designers, and side-project enthusiasts who use AI (Cursor, Gemini, etc.) to generate code.

**Pain Point:** They waste time (and expensive AI tokens) configuring projects, debugging AI-generated messes, and struggle to achieve a professional aesthetic.

**Core Motivation:** They want to focus 100% on their idea, not infrastructure, and launch a beautiful product quickly.

### Key Insight
> They don't understand why they need this kit because they write something to Cursor and it works, but underneath is a mess.

The landing page must **surface this hidden problem** and make them realize the chaos lurking beneath their "working" code.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Constraints & Stack

- **Framework:** SvelteKit with Svelte 5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Motion:** Motion library for animations
- **Design:** Light Theme ONLY
- **Accent Color:** Orange (`bg-orange-600` for primary elements)
- **Font:** Inter (default)

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic Rules (CRITICAL)

1. **Minimal & Clean:** Layout must be minimal, using ample white space and clean typography.

2. **Icons:** Use Hugeicons free icons.

3. **Icon Container Rule:** Every utility icon must be placed inside a circular container with the accent color or border. **Never place a bare icon next to text.**

4. **Motion:** Smooth, subtle motion effects (scale-up on hover, fade-in on scroll) to give a polished, professional feel.

5. **No Header:** Focus immediately on pain points. No traditional navigation header.

## 📖 The Story (Narrative Arc)

### The Hook: Surface the Hidden Problem
People think their AI-generated code works. It runs. It looks fine. But they don't see what's underneath: duplicate functions, inconsistent naming, no design system, brittle structure. **Every new prompt makes it worse.** They're building on quicksand.

### The Revelation: AI is a Junior Developer
AI doesn't write *good* code, it writes *code*. It has no taste. It has no sense of architecture. It needs guardrails, structure, and a senior developer's foundation to build on.

### The Solution: A Foundation That Fixes Everything
This kit gives your AI what it's missing: a designer-engineered codebase with guardrails that auto-clean messy output. Professional aesthetic from line one. 20+ hours of setup already done.

### The Transformation: From Config Hell to Creation
Stop burning tokens on setup. Stop fighting configuration. Focus 100% on your idea. From download to first feature prompt in under 5 minutes.

## ✍️ Content Hierarchy & Copy

### Section 1: Hero (The Uncomfortable Truth)

**Hook Badge:** "Your code looks fine. Look closer."

**Headline:** 
> Your AI writes code.  
> *Not good code.*

**Pain Point:**
> You prompt. It runs. Victory?
>
> Underneath: duplicate functions, inconsistent naming, no design system, brittle structure. Every new prompt makes it worse. You're building on quicksand.

**CTA:** Get the Foundation (€49.99)

### Section 2: The Value (3 Pillars) - The Real Problem

**Section Header:** "AI is a junior developer. It needs guardrails, structure, and taste."

**Pillar 1: You're burning tokens on setup**
> ~~Configure Tailwind. Fix ESLint. Add Prettier. Debug the build.~~  
> We did it once. You never will again.

**Pillar 2: AI has no taste**
> It generates code. It doesn't generate *design systems*. This kit was made by a designer. Your AI inherits the taste.

**Pillar 3: You want to build, not configure**
> Idea to first feature prompt in under 5 minutes. No config rabbit holes. No debugging AI's configuration mistakes. Just build.
